# Hide (g)n(v) Seek Presentation

HNS is an app that focuses on community building by allowing
users to share information about businesses and places of
interest through QR codes.

Users can scan a QR code in order to get some historical
information about a location and a random community story
from a Gainesvillian just like you!

So where does the hide and seek come in? You can see a list
of hints that your friends have left for you at the places
they've been to. If you're clever, you'll be able to find
the point of interest and you'll get a reward for figuring
out the clue. You'll get some history and a cool story
along the way too!

So now that you've heard about the amazing idea, you're
probably thinking there's no way we have a working version
of this during a hackathon right? Well ... let's see.

> * User mirrors phone to display, if possible.
> * User walks over to QR code #1 (bring it up on a laptop)
>  * Scan QR code and show the location and history
>  * Submit your own story
>  * Admin approves story
>  * User2 loads the same QR code and gets the story
> * User checks out hints, selects a hint
> * User scans QR code #2. Nothin' doin'
> * User scans QR code #3. Found it!
