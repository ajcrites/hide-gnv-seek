# Hide (g)n(v) Seek

Want to play hide and seek with your communinit, discover
new interesting places, and eat great food? This is the app
for you!

## Installation

* `yarn install` to get started. Then you'll be good to go!

## Development

After installation, run `yarn build -- --watch`. Then, open
`index.html` in a browser (or use a static file server
such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`) and you should see the
app.

When you make changes the app will rebuild automatically,
but there is no hmr right now so you'll have to reload
yourself.
